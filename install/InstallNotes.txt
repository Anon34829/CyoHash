---CyoHash 2.4.0

Thank you for downloading CyoHash!

Version 2 introduces a new window that contains a list of files being hashed; hashing multiple files no longer opens a new window for each file.

I'd be extremely grateful for any feedback on the change, whether good or bad!

--Installation
Please close all open Windows Explorer instances before proceeding, otherwise you'll probably need to reboot (Windows XP users will unfortunately need to reboot regardless).

--Usage
CyoHash usage is unchanged; simply right-click a file (or files) in Windows Explorer, select CyoHash, then select the algorithm. That's it!
Right-click within the list to display a context menu; this can be used for pausing, resuming, or cancelling a hashing operation.
Double-click a hashed file in the list to bring up the original dialog, into which a hash can be pasted to provide simple hash validation.

--Support
